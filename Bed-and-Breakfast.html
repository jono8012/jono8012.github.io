				<p>New Zealand is well known for its warm welcoming hospitality, and there’s no better way to experience this by staying at one of Queenstown’s bed and breakfasts, homestays, 
				farm stays, or hosted boutique lodges. If you are looking for accommodation with the personal touch, and the comforts of home, a hosted property is for you. Many B&B’s are 
				located a short drive from central Queenstown or in nearby Arrowtown or Glenorchy, where you can interact with your hosts over breakfast and pick their brain for local knowledge.</p>
