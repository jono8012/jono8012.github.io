				<p>Queenstown, New Zealand has a huge range of accommodation styles to suit every age and stage, style and budget. Many large hotels and resorts 
				are located centrally within walking distance of the town's centre, and if you’re after something away from the hustle and bustle, hotels line 
				the shores of Lake Wakatipu and can also be found in neighbouring Arrowtown. Motels in Queenstown are a great option for families, couples and business 
				travellers looking for a bit of space to spread out in a self-contained environment. The budget conscious traveller can book into backpacker accommodation, 
				and if you’re travelling with a tent or camper, Queenstown has a number of well-equipped and centrally located holiday parks. If you’re looking for a 
				homely feel try one of Queenstown’s bed and breakfasts in surrounding Arrowtown or Glenorchy. </p>
